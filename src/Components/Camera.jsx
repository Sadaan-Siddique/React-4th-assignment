                <p className='col-12'>A camera is an optical instrument used to capture still images or record moving pictures, typically by digitally or chemically processing light. Modern cameras come in a variety of forms, including smartphones, digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) cameras, and mirrorless cameras, and can be used for a wide range of photography, from amateur snapshot-taking to professional photojournalism and art photography. Cameras typically include a lens, a shutter, and a sensor or film to capture the image, as well as various controls and settings to adjust the exposure, focus, and other elements of the photograph.
                    The first camera was invented by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce in 1826. He created a device called the "heliograph," which used a polished pewter plate coated in bitumen, a light-sensitive material, to capture an image. The plate was exposed to light through a small aperture for several hours, and then washed with a solvent to remove the unhardened bitumen, leaving a permanent image.
                    This process was called "heliography" and it was the first photographic process.
                    It was improved over time by many inventors including Louis Daguerre who developed the daguerreotype process in 1837, which used a silver-plated copper sheet instead of pewter and a shorter exposure time.
                    A camera captures light through a lens and focuses it onto a light-sensitive surface, such as film or a digital sensor. The lens can be adjusted to control the amount of light and the angle of the light that enters the camera, while the aperture controls the size of the lens opening. The shutter controls the amount of time that the light-sensitive surface is exposed to the incoming light. In digital cameras, the image is captured by the sensor and processed by the camera's computer to create a digital image that can be stored and displayed on a screen. Film cameras use a physical film to capture the image, which must then be developed to be viewed.
